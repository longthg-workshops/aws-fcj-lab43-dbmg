AWS DMS Serverless eliminates the guesswork and operational burden of managing migration resources by automatically provisioning, scaling, and optimizing capacity. It offers built-in high availability and a pay-for-use billing model, allowing you to begin migrations quickly with minimal oversight while optimizing costs and increasing operational agility. This feature also removes the need for manual tasks such as capacity estimation, provisioning, cost management, and replication engine maintenance.

In this module, we will demonstrate:

- How to use the AWS DMS Serverless feature for data migration. You'll start by setting up a DMS Serverless to perform a full load and CDC operation.

- After that, you'll generate some activity on the source database to observe how DMS Serverless automatically scales in response to the workload.

By the end of this module, you will have hands-on experience in configuring and managing DMS Serverless for efficient and automated data migration.
